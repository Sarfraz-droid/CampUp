## Inspiration
This project was inspired by online selling apps like Olx. Which basically finds products depending on your nearest location. CampUp does a similar task but with events. People can look, find and create different events.

## What it does
CampUp allows users to register on different events and create events as well. Users can see their data depending on the location the want.

## How we built it
The project was built on React, Material UI and Firebase. The whole auth and database system is worked on firebase itself

## Challenges we ran into
One main challenge was to sort the events depending on their latitudinal and longitudinal positions.
However I then resorted to on finding the distance and sorting it similarly

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I was proud on how the whole app was just connected to each other. I was really happy to see all the different components and parts working together

## What we learned
I learned a lot about firebase , geocoding and a little bit of maths as well

## What's next for CampUp
1. Inbuilt chatting system that allows users to chat in the app itself
2. Better database structure.
3. UI improvements
4. Bug fixes
5. Mty profile section
